# Resistance

Resistance is the ability of a material to oppose the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Ω).

**Analogy:**

Resistance is like the obstacles that participants in a sporting event must overcome to reach the finish line. The higher the resistance, the harder it is for the current to flow.

**Data:**

> - **Name:** Resistance
